# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a web application that allows students to upload and view their website assignments and for instructors to access and grade them. To ensure the successful completion of this project, we need to establish a solid foundation with a proper project setup.

## Theme:
The theme for this project setup is to ensure that we have a robust and scalable architecture for the web application. This includes establishing the necessary infrastructure, defining development practices, and setting up the necessary tools and platforms to support the project.

## Initiative(s)

1. Define the development environment:
* Determine the tools and technologies required for the project, such as programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.
* Establish development guidelines, including coding conventions and standards for version control.

2. Set up infrastructure:
* Configure the server and database environment to support the web application.
* Set up hosting services and ensure scalability to support growth.

3. Establish testing procedures:
* Define testing processes and tools to ensure that the web application meets quality standards.
* Develop a plan to test the application thoroughly, including functionality, performance, and security.

## Test plan
1. Functional Testing:
* Test the functionality of the application to ensure that it meets user requirements.
* Verify that users can upload and view their website assignments and that instructors can access and grade them.

2. Performance Testing:
* Test the performance of the web application under different load conditions to ensure that it can handle a large number of users.
* Verify that the application performs well under normal and peak load conditions.

3. Security Testing:
* Test the security of the web application to ensure that it is protected against potential threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Verify that user data is secured and encrypted, and only authorized users have access to the application.

By focusing on these initiatives and test plans, we can ensure that we have a solid foundation for the development of the web application.
