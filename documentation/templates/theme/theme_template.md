As a student enrolled in a college web development course, I want to easily upload and deploy my website projects, access course assignments, and view my grades in one location. This will allow me to efficiently manage my coursework and stay on top of my academic progress.

By developing a user-friendly website for a college web development course that integrates project submission, assignment management, and grade tracking, we can achieve our project objective of providing a seamless and efficient experience for students.

This will enable us to create a website that meets the needs of the target audience and enhances their learning experience. By following agile and lean methodologies, we can quickly and effectively deliver a high-quality website that meets our project objectives. This approach will set us up for long-term benefit by equipping us with the skills and knowledge needed to work collaboratively as a team and deliver successful projects in the future.

Our project deliverables will include wireframes, mockups, user stories, and code repositories that demonstrate our progress and help us stay organized throughout the development process.

By following the principles of agile and lean development, we can iterate and improve upon our website as needed to ensure that it meets the evolving needs of our users. Each member on the team will have a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities.
