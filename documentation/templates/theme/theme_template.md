To provide students with easy access to course materials, submissions of their websites, assignments, and grades all in one location, we aim to create a user-friendly website for a college web development course. Additionally, students will have the option to make their website submissions public, enabling other students to view and access them. By adopting agile and lean methodologies, we can efficiently develop a website that satisfies user requirements.

The objective is to deliver a website that meets the needs of the target audience, improves their learning experience and enables efficient management of their coursework. Our agile and lean approach will enable us to iterate quickly, prioritize tasks effectively, and incorporate user feedback to ensure the website is user-friendly.

The deliverables will include wireframes, mockups, user stories, and code repositories to demonstrate our progress and maintain organization throughout the development process. This approach will prepare us to work collaboratively as a team, develop our skills, and deliver successful projects in the future.
